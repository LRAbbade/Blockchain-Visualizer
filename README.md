# Blockchain Visualizer
A Blockchain visualizing web app.

The goal of this project is to make a Blockchain visualization platform. It should display newly generated blocks in real time and allow users to search the Blockchain for a specific block, using its hash.

Searches made in the platform will be stored in a MongoDB for further analysis.

### Architecture

Frontend is made using [ejs](http://ejs.co/) and [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Backend in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [express](https://expressjs.com/).

Database is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
